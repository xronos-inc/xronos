        This is an implementation of the Python descriptor protocol. It is used
        to manage the deceleration and instantiation of reactions. The complete
        protocol is split between this class and the `Reactor` base class.

        Reaction descriptors are instantiated when the `@reaction` decorator is
        used (see :func:`reaction`). The annotated function is expected to
        accept a reactor instance and a reaction interface as arguments and to
        return a reaction handler. The function is expected to use the given
        reactor interface to declare the reaction's dependencies.

        Python's descriptor protocol ensures that `__set_name__` is called once
        during construction of the containing (reactor) class. We use this, to
        record the reaction name and register the descriptor using
        `_register_reaction_descriptor` provided by each reactor class.
        `_register_reaction_descriptor` also returns
        a priority, which the descriptor records for later use.

        During initialization `_initialize` of :class:`Reactor` is called. This
        will call `create_instance` on each recorded reaction descriptor.
        `create_instance` uses the recorded information and returns a new
        `Reaction` instance. The calling `Reactor` instance is responsible for
        storing the reaction instance in its `_reactions` dict. If `__get__` is
        called on the descriptor, it retrieves the concrete instances from the
        `_reactions` dict of the calling reactor.

        Args:
            declaration_func: A callable that accepts a reactor and reaction
                interface as arguments and returns a reaction handler. The
