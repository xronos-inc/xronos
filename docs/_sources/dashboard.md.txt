# Dashboard

The runtime behavior of Xronos programs can be observed using the Xronos
Dashboard. The dashboard consists of a user interface based on
[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) and a time series database that stores telemetry
data such as traces of reaction executions and values recorded using
{ref}`metrics <metrics>`.

## System Requirements

- A running Docker daemon. The Xronos Dashboard has been tested with Docker
  Engine version 27.2.1.

## Installation

Create a new virtual environment or activate the same environment in which you
installed the `xronos` package. Install the dashboard using the following
command:

```console
$ pip install xronos[dashboard]
```

## Usage

Use the following command to start the dashboard:

```console
$ xronos-dashboard start
✔ dashboard available at http://localhost:3000
```

Open [`http://localhost:3000`](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. This will
open the Grafana-based dashboard. On first usage, you need to log in using the
username `admin` and password `xronos`.

After logging in, the trace view opens. Initially, it will be empty.

![empty dashboard](./_img/dashboard_empty.png)

To show trace data in the dashboard, we need to run a Xronos application that
has telemetry enabled. Telemetry can be enabled on any application by calling
{func}`~xronos.Environment.enable_telemetry` on the environment. Note that this
has to happen before calling execute {func}`~xronos.Environment.execute`.

Modify the {ref}`py_hello_world` example like shown below.

```python
env = xronos.Environment()
env.create_reactor("hello", Hello)
env.enable_telemetry()
env.execute()
```

Then execute the program.

```console
$ python hello.py
```

The single reaction execution should register as a data point in the dashboard.

The trace view is most useful for analyzing the execution of more complex
applications. For instance, below you can see the trace view for the
{ref}`YOLO<yolo>` example, when run with the `--telemetry` argument.

## Visualizing Metrics

We can also use the dashboard to visualize data values recorded for
{ref}`metrics <metrics>`. When you run an application that uses {ref}`metrics`
while the dashboard is running and telemetry is enabled, this will also store any
values recorded by the application in the database. For instance, you can run
the [Monte Carlo
example](https://github.com/xronos-inc/xronos/tree/main/examples/montecarlo),
which already includes a few metrics. The example estimates the value of pi and
includes metrics for the current estimate, the estimation error, and the number
of processed points.

When running a simulation with telemetry set to enabled in the web interface, the
traces of executed reactions should be shown in the default dashboard.

![montecarlo dashboard](./_img/dashboard_montecarlo.png)

The default dashboard is pre-filled at the bottom with a basic time series view
of your program's metrics, if your program reports any. In the image above, the
currently-selected metric is `SimulationAggregator._current_estimate`.

However, it is also possible to customize the dashboard and write queries that
might be better suited to your application. Click the "Edit" button in the
top-right corner of the Grafana UI to customize the dashboard.

![dashboard enter edit mode](./_img/dashboard_enter_edit_mode.png)

You can then add visualizations to select any time series of interest from your
application.

![dashboard add visualization](./_img/dashboard_add_visualization.png)

We use [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/) for storing the collected data.
InfluxDB supports two query languages:
[InfluxQL](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2/query-data/influxql/)
and
[Flux](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/cloud/query-data/flux/).
We recommend InfluxQL as it is similar to other database query languages and is
forward-compatible to upcoming versions of InfluxDB, but you may also select the
Flux data source if you prefer.

Choose the InfluxDB InfluxQL data source to use the graphical InfluxQL editor.

![dashboard InfluxQL data source](./_img/dashboard_influxql_data_source.png)

Select "metrics" in the `FROM` clause to visualize metrics.

![dashboard metrics measurement](./_img/dashboard_metrics_measurement.png)

Delete the default `GROUP BY` clause. If you would like to visualize multiple
metrics, you might want to group them by the `xronos.fqn` tag.

![dashboard group by](./_img/dashboard_group_by.png)

Finally, select the `xronos.value` field which holds the value of any recorded metric.

![dashboard xronos value field](./_img/dashboard_xronos_value_field.png)

You should now see a line plot like the one below.

![dashboard montecarlo plot](./_img/dashboard_montecarlo_plot.png)

Adjust the time window to your liking to zoom in on the data. Note that you may click and hold to select a time range that interests you.

![dashboard montecarlo plot zoom](./_img/dashboard_montecarlo_plot_zoom.png)

You may use the `WHERE` clause to apply a filter. For instance, in the image below only the current estimate of pi is visualized.

![dashboard montecarlo plot estimat](./_img/dashboard_montecarlo_plot_estimate.png)

If you wish to see it in real time, you should
set a refresh interval.

![dashboard set refresh interval](./_img/dashboard_refresh_interval.png)

Save your changes to ensure that they persist, even when stopping the dashboard.

## Upgrading Dashboard Versions

Updating the `xronos-dashboard` CLI tool will also update the versions of the
Docker images that it depends on. Any time you update the underlying Docker
images, you should keep the following in mind:
- By default, the state of your Grafana instance is preserved in a Docker volume,
  and upgrading the image does not cause that volume to be replaced. This ensures
  that data that you may need is preserved by default. However, it also means that
  some updates to the default dashboard released by Xronos will not propagate to
  your instance automatically unless you delete the existing Docker volume.
- When there is an update, your browser may cache the site content, which can
  create an inconsistency between the code running in your browser and the code
  running in the Docker image. As a result, you may need to clear the site data
  associated with `localhost`. In Firefox, you can do this by going to "Settings
  \> Privacy and Security \> Cookies and Site Data \> Manage Data."

## Closing the Dashboard

When you are done, you may stop the dashboard.

```console
$ xronos-dashboard stop
✔ stopped
```

In case you want to delete all state, including all collected telemetry data and
custom queries, you can use the following command.

```console
$ xronos-dashboard delete
✔ stopped
```
