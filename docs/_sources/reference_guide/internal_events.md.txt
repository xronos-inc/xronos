# Internal Events

Internal events provide a convenient way for reactors to schedule future
behavior. While ports can be used to send messages to other reactors, internal
events can be seen as a mechanism for a reactor to send a delayed messages to
its future self.

The following example replicates the behavior of a {ref}`timer<timer>` using an
internal event.


`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} plain
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/event.py
```
````
````{group-tab} with type hints
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/event_hints.py
```

````
`````

The `Clock` reactor declares an internal event called `_event` using an
{class}`~xronos.InternalEventDeclaration`. The reactor further defines two
reactions. The `tick` reaction is triggered by `_event` and prints a message
that includes the current time. The `next` reaction is triggered both by
{attr}`~xronos.Reactor.startup` and by `_event`. It also declares an effect on
`_event`. Using the {class}`~xronos.InternalEventEffect` object, the reaction
may call {func}`~xronos.InternalEventEffect.schedule` to schedule a future
occurrence of the event. In this example, the reaction handler calls
`_schedule_next()` which in turn calls
{func}`~xronos.InternalEventEffect.schedule` using `self._period` as delay.

The `next` reaction ensures that `_event` triggers in regular intervals. The
first invocation of `next` is triggered by {attr}`~xronos.Reactor.startup`. This
schedules the first occurrence of `_event`. All subsequent invocations of `next`
will be triggered by `_event` itself.

When executed, the program produces the following output.
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/event_out.txt
:language: console
```

While we can use internal events to replicate the behavior of timers, they are a
lot more versatile. Since occurrences are scheduled by reactions, the reaction
handlers gain full control over when events occur. This allows us to implement
more interesting behavior. For instance, the following example implements a
clock that slows down with each tick.

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} plain
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/event_slowing.py
:start-at: class SlowingClock
```
````
````{group-tab} with type hints
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/event_slowing_hints.py
:start-at: class SlowingClock
```
````
````{group-tab} diagram
![diagram slowing clock](./_img/diagram_event_slowing_clock.png){.bg-warning w="60%" align=center}
````
`````

With this modification, the program produces the following output.
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/event_slowing_out.txt
:language: console
```
