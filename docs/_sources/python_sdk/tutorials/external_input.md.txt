# External Input

In the Xronos SDK, {ref}`ports` are the primary mechanism for sending and
receiving data. However, often programs also have to read input from components
that are not directly controlled by the SDK. For instance, a program might
want to receive input from a file, from the console, or from a socket. For this, the
Xronos SDK provides a set of library reactors that allow receiving input
from external data sources. They assign a timestamp to any data received and
forward the data using an output port. Currently, the following library reactors
are provided for reading external input.

- {class}`xronos.lib.ConsoleInput`
- {class}`xronos.lib.SocketInput`
- {class}`xronos.lib.ExternalInput`

```{note}
While it is possible to use blocking reads in reaction handlers
(e.g., `input(...)`), this is discouraged as it potentially
blocks the entire program and no other reactions are executed in the meantime.
Using the library input reactors ensures that blocking reads do not affect
the overall program execution.
```

## Reading from Console

The {class}`~xronos.lib.ConsoleInput` can be used to read data from the console.
Consider the following example program.

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} plain
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/console.py
```
````
````{group-tab} with type hints
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/console_hints.py
```
````
````{group-tab} diagram
![diagram clock](./_img/diagram_console.png){.bg-warning w="70%" align=center}
````
`````

This program defines a simple `Printer` reactor. It prints any strings that it
receives on its input port. If it receives the strings `"exit"` or
`"quit"`, it terminates the program using a {class}`~xronos.ShutdownEffect`.
The `main()` function instantiates the `Printer`
reactor and connects its input to an instance of
{class}`~xronos.lib.ConsoleInput`. The custom parser function that is provided
as an argument simply forwards all received strings.

When executing the program, it immediately echos any lines entered by the user
and terminates if the user types "quit" or "exit".

```console
$ python console.py
> test
> test
exit
```

## Reading from a Socket

The {class}`~xronos.lib.InputSocket` reactor allows receiving data from a
socket. Consider the following example program.

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} plain
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/socket_.py
```
````
````{group-tab} with type hints
```{literalinclude} ../_examples/socket_hints.py
```
````
````{group-tab} diagram
![diagram clock](./_img/diagram_socket.png){.bg-warning w="70%" align=center}
````
`````

This instantiates the {class}`~xronos.lib.InputSocket` reactor in TCP server
mode listening on port 1234 of `localhost`. Any data received on the socket will
be printed by the `Printer` reactor.

Try running the program and then open
[`http://loalhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234) in your browser. This should
produce output similar to the following:

```console
$ python socket.py
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:1234

```

## Other Input

{class}`~xronos.lib.ExternalInput` is a generic reactor that can be used to read
input from arbitrary other sources. It is configured with an arbitrary
[generator](https://realpython.com/introduction-to-python-generators/). The
generator is expected to yield received values. Any value yielded from the
generator will be timestamped and forwarded to the output port. See
{class}`~xronos.lib.ExternalInput` for usage instructions and an example
generator function.
